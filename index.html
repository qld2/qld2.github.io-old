			<p>I am currently a freshman at the University of Illinois majoring in 
			physics looking to hopefully transfer into Computer Science in the School of Engineering.
			While I do not know exactly what field I will go into I plan on becoming a software engineer/backend programmer.
			I am currently exploring my options with internships this summer as I finished last summer with a business internship.
			</p>
			
			<p> Personally, my hobbies include snowboarding, playing guitar and spending time with family and friends.
			I enjoy wasting more money than I should at punk rock and rap concerts. One of my most proud achievements 
		    is that I have stage dove. Also check out the cool C++ game I made over the summer on my github (I'm looking into
			ways to package it as an executable). Below are also some cool programs I made when I was bored to give this page a little more
			spunk and random functionality. Cheers!</p>
