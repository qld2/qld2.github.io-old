			<p>I am currently a freshman at the University of Illinois majoring in 
			physics looking to hopefully transfer into Computer Science in the School of Engineering.
			Currently my main academic interests are data sciences, abstract mathematics and differential geometry
			(especially as it relates to general relativity). I intend on becoming more involved with RSO's like ACM here at 
			the University of Illinois and have plans to intern at a sign technology company over the summer. Another
			large goal of mine is to greatly expand my github and to participate in open source projects</p>
			
			<p> Personally, my hobbies include snowboarding, playing guitar and spending time with family and friends.
			I enjoy wasting more money than I should at punk rock and rap concerts. One of my most proud achievements 
		    is that I have stage dove. I love math on a nerdy level: I have a white board full of proofs on my dorm door white board. </p>
