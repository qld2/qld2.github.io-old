			<p>I am currently a junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign majoring in
				Computer Science. I am most interested in backend programming and machine learning.
				Professionally I plan on pursuing a career in financial engineering and
				eventually returning to graduate school for a masters degree.
			</p>
			
			<p> Personally, my hobbies include snowboarding, playing guitar and spending time with family and friends.
				I enjoy wasting more money than I should at punk rock and rap concerts. Also check out the cool C++ game I made
				over the summer on my github. Below are also some cool programs I made when I was bored to give this page a
				little more spunk and random functionality. Cheers!</p>
